_day 4_

I miss the [Daily Dish](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/).

Whenever I think of Sundays on the interwebs, I think of how Andrew Sullivan did it, orienting this day around art, culture, and religion. Finding significance. Exploring purpose. Reviving meaning and grand narrative.

He would use this day to remind himself (and us) that much of the petty jargon we wrap ourselves in on a day to day basis falls away when we pause to orient ourselves in the universe. It offers context. It helps to lend shared purpose.

And so today I reread some Sontag ("Against Interpretation"), I skimmed Brainpickings, and I flipped through "Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity" all in some sort of effort to remind myself of the grand narratives my current work falls into.

I nearly watched an Ingmar Bergman film ("The Silence"), but the wifi at my house went out (tragedy). And I ended up watching "Bee Season" (with Juliette Binoche) later. A strange film about a spelling bee, and the deep-seeded (seated?) power of words. How we worship words. How word act as shards - and our spoken/written artistry an attempt to piece together these shards. To make something whole.

I'm not sure.

My reminiscient, ever pretentious Sunday post lost steam as soon as Game of Thrones became an option. I'll do better next week. Lol. #drinkwineknowthings
