_day 1_

Two weekends ago I was on a couch in UVA because of a twitter exchange. And I met a fellow named [Elliot Roth](https://medium.com/@elliotroth) who decided to spend a hundred days writing on Medium. A post a day. With the aim of becoming a better writer, of thinking forward in his field.

I've now written a couple of pieces over the past few days. And I'd like it to continue. It's liberating.

I've got this gut feeling that the act of writing in public as a student could be interesting, could be enlightening. And there's a couple of educators who claim to read this stuff. And there's a splendid move towards open happening in my life.

So I'm going to write a post a day for the next hundred days. This may irritate you. So be it. But I've got a slew of thoughts and a lot of process to move through, and a lot of assumptions to break, and a lot of considerations to... well consider.

This also was prompted by [Robin DeRosa](https://twitter.com/actualham)'s tweet yesterday, where a single question prompted an evening of replies, responses, and conversation. Follow this tweet to see what I mean:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Working on a keynote for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenUnbound?src=hash">#OpenUnbound</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidsonCollege">@DavidsonCollege</a>.

My network may just be at critical mass. And I'd like to learn from it. Learn in public. Learn in process. So I'll start - more likely tomorrow than today - by flirting with these first few questions:

- Who gets to work in the open (as I plan to work for 100 days)?
- How does a network reach a critical mass? How do digital communities form? Who is being blocked from such communities by structures around access?
- What the heck should I write about?

Tweet or email if you have thoughts or ideas and I'll weave them into later thoughts. Be back tomorrow.
