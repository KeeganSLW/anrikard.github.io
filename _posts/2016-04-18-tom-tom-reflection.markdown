I came to Charlottesville to connect with folks doing powerful work in Education. I did. So here's another reflection. I'm 30 minutes away from a presentation by Mary Jo Madda, Senior EdSurge Editor, and all-around bad*ss. And a need a moment to repaint the picture I started yesterday.

### Focus on Community

What's permeated every aspect of this trip is the community focus of this town - so many powerful intersections between students, community partners, local teachers/administrators. You hear a similar slew of names come up again and again, across borders.

When we're looking to shake up education for good, it won't happen with an eye glancing up towards the feds. It'll come as a collaborative effort around a community. Now Charlottesville has the distinct privilege of surrounding a world-class university, flush with Virginia's brilliance. And the community has leveraged these minds for change, partnering to create spaces where students can keep a foot in school and a foot in the world. These split students, living lives at the border of courses and community effectually pop bubbles where they find them. (But both privileged of course: the school and the community.)

### A Community at the Border of Communities
The best example of this idea is the organization, **Hack CVille**. When I first showed up in this town on Wednesday (jeez I've been here for a while), I worked late into the night inside their _clubhouse_, sponsored by UVA, but founded separate from it. It's off-campus, community guided, and student run - they've got couches, coffee machines, and horde of stickers, post-its, and posters. They work to offer students a space to incubate ideas for community change. This isn't technically for Entrepreneurship, but rather for entrepreneurial endeavors. They encourage a project-based approach to change, offering a place to rethink, redesign, or reimagine something or another. It's opt-in, loosely scaffolded, and open deep into the night on a Wednesday. I can't help but wonder what curriculum credit would do to their passion... Poison it? Perhaps?

## Entrepreneurial Spirit
This _spirit_ is different from the act of perpetual pitchmanship. Something about pitching always hits me wrong - it feels fake and a tid-bit nasty. I understand it's purpose, but the nearly unmediated chase after capital makes me uncomfortable. Cash or credits tend to feel dirty. They've gotta sit secondary if we're gonna honor true passion.

But the spirit of entrepreneurship, the ever-glorified "find a problem and solve it." Well, I love it. And that's the uncapturable essence we've got to capture and plug into EDU. Because that right there is what we **need** in education. First and foremost because education has a laundry list of fixable problems on it that doesn't leverage the millions of minds who walk it's long, flourescent corridors. If we're looking for motivation, a group of students sitting at the border of school & community, skeptical of both, and willing to challenge the "way of things" with new solutions would (could) do the trick.

Perhaps the greatest lesson I've learned this week is that liminal space (that space at the border) feels key to whole human-ship. Buying whole-heartedly into singular ideologies screws us over. Feels most relevant to create a life with different limbs in different arenas - forming community in the spaces between. Together, we identity ourselves as a group of conflicted identities.

And I realize how utterly basic this sounds.

BUT - this is interdisciplinarity, breaking down time blocks, credit structures, hyper-focused unapplied lectures. De-siloing. We must desilo.
