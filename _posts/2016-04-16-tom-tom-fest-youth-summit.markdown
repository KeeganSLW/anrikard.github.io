_Forgive my blogging fever dreams_

The night before the Tom Tom Fest Youth Summit, I sat in the [Hack CVille](http://hackcville.com/) clubhouse with Keaton, Jared (conference organizers), and Elliot (emcee) till 3am drinking burnt coffee, eating Bamboo Lane Crunchy Rice Rollers and finishing up all the little details. I'd first met them (in person) 2 hours before.

They were each skipping out on school or job to realize this summit, a group of impassioned innovators, making the choice to create a festival before a dime or a 4.0.

And so I wrote a post yesterday about student entrepreneurship as a way to escape the ideological control of Higher Ed and make something. Flee from passivity, control, domination. Flee from [lectures](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/opinion/sunday/lecture-me-really.html?_r=0), towards [projects](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/04/14/465729968/a-nobel-laureates-education-plea-revolutionize-teaching).

But that flight from the boring domination of lectures and essays quickly turns into another form of domination - scalability, pitch nights, funding models, revenue, valuation, acquisition.

I'd argue that the freedom lies in the thrill of oscillation. It's the transition away from one prison and the pleasure of exploring the second. The ability to move between them, between spaces, well that's the freedom. I'm never going to escape ideologies, right? But I can find freedom in moving between them, chuckling at the ironies of the "this machine kills venture capitalists" sticker next to the glowing apple logo.

Oscillation in and out of power systems subverts the purpose of the powerful systems. Neither school nor Entrepreneurship can control you when you shift quickly between them. In the same way, true community is subversion too. It's the unquantifiable love of a friend. The subversive freedom in this oscillation is the best type of community - using movement as a way to empathize across disparate spectra.

Ugh - and the tragedy of this post is its deep assumptions in and of social capital. Can't ignore it. The model available to some is not available to others. To aggressively empathize across walls and borders. To meet in empathy at the borders of roles, identities, and quantifications. To crush power with ambiguity.

Perhaps freedom in the oscillation is the fundamental tenet of community. It's an unquantified freedom to associate. It's a qualitative self-formation. For a moment, you break out of "number-as-identity" and into a world of moving ambiguity where the primary questions are how to love well together. How to take care of each other. How to hug, kiss, and dream together. The ranking fades.

Now - and here's the trick - Higher Education _should_ be the ideal space for exploration in oscillation in community. It should be the center of a massive venn diagram. Higher ed should be a borderland. Where students are encouraged to explore a range of expressions and valuations - currently inhibited by the ever-standardizing GPA. Spend a term on a project, a month on a critical literary text, and a phase on your business. Document the process. Defend your learning process in front of a review board. And get a degree (one that exists secondarily to the body of work produced).

Connect students with the community. Form empathy, not social-class-reproducability. Pop bubbles. Break down the isolation of the brick campuses and encourage community partnerships that drive individuals from school into world. Promote connection. Encourage research, study, and experimentation. Oscillate in and out of hierarchical dominations.

Maybe if Education was liminal instead of institutional, a curious borderland instead of slingshot for a particular type of human, an empathetic community of practice, a self-directed, mentored, community. Well. Could we try it?

Oh and never forget to allow for a students to publish fever dreams on their blog.
