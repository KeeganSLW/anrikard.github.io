So I've made it to Tom Tom Fest at UVA, folks. And I'm absolutely loving it. It's an exhausting feast of entrepreneurship.

But tom tom's more a story of strange connections and expanding networks. A week ago I sent a tweet out to a recent student [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-07-why-student-voice-means-more-than-choice) contributor, [Keaton Wadzinski](https://twitter.com/kwadzki):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Kwadzki">@Kwadzki</a> give me a follow! I&#39;d love to DM about a Google Hangout - hear your vision for Higher Ed.</p>&mdash; Andrew Rikard (@anrikard) <a href="https://twitter.com/anrikard/status/718459185969643520">April 8, 2016</a></blockquote>

Only to start a DM chain of magnitude:

And before I knew it, I'd asked for a place to stay - had a couch - and was on my way up.

On Thursday, I got a chance to wander around the [Tom Tom Youth Summit](http://tomtomfest.com/events/youth-summit/) and Nikhil Goyal (incredible young voice in education reform) talked about leveraging youth to make connections. How you can cold-call-email anyone at any level and *probably* get a conversation/phone-call out of it.

Now - I do think privilege/credential/social-capital have sway here. Modern networking is flush with codes, cues, and secrets "natural" to the initiated and befuddling to the excluded. And this deserves a post of its own.

BUT - most of the time - a note on twitter, a phone call - can turn into a conversation - can turn into a couch for the weekend.
