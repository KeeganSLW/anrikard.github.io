So I've made it to [Tom Tom Fest](http://tomtomfest.com/) at UVA, folks. And I'm absolutely loving it. It's an exhausting feast of entrepreneurship.

But tom tom's more a story of strange connections and expanding networks. A week ago I sent a tweet out to a recent student [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-07-why-student-voice-means-more-than-choice) contributor, [Keaton Wadzinski](https://twitter.com/kwadzki):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Kwadzki">@Kwadzki</a> give me a follow!

Only to start a DM chain of magnitude:

And before I knew it, I'd asked for a place to stay - had a couch - and was on my way up.

On Thursday, I wandered around the [Tom Tom Youth Summit](http://tomtomfest.com/events/youth-summit/), organized by Keaton, and Nikhil Goyal (incredible young voice in education reform) mentioned leveraging your youth to make connections. How you can cold-call-email anyone at any level and *probably* get a conversation out of it.

Now, I do think privilege/credential/social-capital have sway here. Networking's flush with codes, cues, and secrets "natural" to the initiated and befuddling to the excluded. And this deserves a post of its own.

But its the reaching out that matters. Breaking out of the isolated circles closest to you and driving some empathy. This is the realized potential of the web. Connecting disparate nodes with similar interests. When the flying bits and bytes turn into new drinking-ed-reform buddies, well its magic.
