So I've made it to Tom Tom Fest at UVA, folks. And I'm absolutely loving it. It's an exhausting feast of entrepreneurship.

But tom tom's more a story of strange connections and expanding networks. A week ago I sent a tweet out to a recent student EdSurge contributor, Keaton Wadzinski:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Kwadzki">@Kwadzki</a> give me a follow! I&#39;d love to DM about a Google Hangout - hear your vision for Higher Ed.</p>&mdash; Andrew Rikard (@anrikard) <a href="https://twitter.com/anrikard/status/718459185969643520">April 8, 2016</a></blockquote>

Only to start a DM chain of magnitude:

And before I knew it, I'd asked for a place to stay - had a couch - and was on my way to UVA for the weekend.
