_warning. i’m trying to blurb my life with less anxiety over what I write. views may not be my own._

Last week I reflected on the Personal API weekend, submitting my piece to [EdSurge](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjdp7CayPDLAhXCuoMKHfC_Bx8QFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edsurge.com%2Fnews%2F2016-03-25-how-personal-apis-let-students-design-their-university&usg=AFQjCNExXufswrimyYT_IRqBrarty-dK_Q&sig2=EPHQhna-0E-iwd6CuCGYFg), which became more informative than flush with my voice. Which is ok. But I figured I’d put down a second piece with a little more of me – and a little less information. This is for thought-jotting. Written on a phone. As I walk around my lil’ neighborhood. If you’re interested in the panoply of reviews that bubbled out of the weekend, well – go [here](http://www.aud.life/2016/indieedtech-the-compilation). Audrey Watters sets it up nicely for everyone.

The trouble – first and foremost – of a personal API is that its complex enough that it can promise to be more than it possibly could be. If that makes sense. I spent about 15 minutes trying to explain the PAPI to my family only to realize that I was stuck in a lot of trenches saying things like – _this will change everything_ – but really operating in the theoretical.

What I’m saying is that the PAPI can be its own form of Tech-Vangelism, writing its own narrative about de-centralized autonomous, loosely joined – anarchic – creative – open wajafew;jiewf;na. Buzzy. Buzzy shit. It sounds good until I try to convince my mom.

And so I think we can get the benefits of a _community_ confusedwith the _tools_ that community uses. So – #indieEdTech > Personal API. It’s great that a group of educators, technologists, and EdTech powerhouses can get hype about a tool. But tools are neutral. Under the pretense of making a tool, what we did at the Personal API weekend was establish a community. And while we talk about the tool, I think we’re confusing it with the community.

Like… a tool is – for good or ill – really just a mirror for whatever community is looking in it.

I can imagine horrible, exploitative uses of a personal API. Ways for Universities to exploit talented students for tool creation. Ways for the breakup of an institutional LMS not to mean freedom for broken up parts, but a pathway for the dirtiest bits of profit-motive to take advantage of students who have no institutional protection.

It’s not about the Personal API. It’s about the people behind the Personal API. It’s about maintaining dialogue across institutions and power structures. It’s about. Well – love and empathy and empowerment for the disenfranchised. And a Personal API **can** do that with the right people behind it.

But tools… They’re not an answer. It’s about community. And I found community at the Papi weekend. I’ve gotten caught up in the tool.

And the #indieEdTech community. Well… they’re the strange difficult bunch that I’m learning to love.
