Just finished the second day of this ordeal - and its a fascinating business. My days have run from dawn to dusk, working full time while turning an ear to presentations and the endless slew of MC's and salesmen.

I woke up today on a couch in the basement of the Center for Christian Study after a bite at Crozet Pizza and a drink at Boylan Heights. I've tagged behind an adreneline-rushed group of conference organizers - like trying to tag along backstage on an opening night.

But it's one of my first encounters with the entrepreneurial world, of start-ups, MVP's, innovation, "Dropbox for Mapquest" and "AirBnB for the Music Industry." Borrow and disrupt. Borrow and disrupt. Creation is appropriation. Etc.

And I'm faced with an odd ideological dilemma.

### Innovation as a space for student passion

I spend so much time thinking about routes toward's student empowerment - finding passions, avoiding passivity, middle-fingers-to-domination. And student entrepreneurship saves kids. It lends value (literally and figuratively), draws you out into a 'real' community, forces you to ask about how the world works - how money flows - and how you fit into that. I'd argue - with only anecdotal evidence - that student entrepreneurship helps students live with mental health issues. It helps them find community, voice, access, meaning.

But.

### Monetization as infestation

What also seems to happen is that passion turns to misery in the funding/vc/real-real world race to the top. It's a competition. With many losers. Value is quantifiable. Success is a metric. In fact - YOU are a metric. When you're paid to do what you previously love, does the empowered passion fade? When scalability is king, well - where's the room for that empowered community-facing fire?

I do see projects (if I understand this right) in the social innovation space as negating this. The community surrounding this style of start-up tends to redescribe the fundamental goal of the venture.

But my gut still sees the money infest it all. And perhaps we're helpless to it in a world based on exchange value.

Damn this got depressing.

### The Hope is Watching Voices Wake Up

The key value proposition of a project like Tom Tom Fest lies in the breakdown of barriers between students and the world they're shielded from. The eyes of 500 high schoolers watching kids three years older present their story to find meaning - well that's wondrous. And sorely needed.

The promises of entrepreneurship, though faulty in part, rustle up student voices in ways that not much else does.
