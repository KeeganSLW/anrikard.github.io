Two days back, I wrote a piece entitled: ["Sorting Through Privilege as Power to Change the Way Things Are."](http://anrikard.github.io/2016/04/25/olc-reflection.html) And I think it excited folks to see a student asking questions in public in that way. But I also received feedback in the form of questions, hard questions. I'm going to explore one of them here. I'm thinking about this as *learning in public*.

### What is your theory of (social) change?

In the piece I make assumptions about who has the power to make change at all:

>And so perhaps the answer to this is to make spaces for challenging the “way things are” for people who don’t have the time and resources to challenge the way things are. And so my challenge to the way things are is: How might education create spaces for those most suffering in the status quo to express their suffering and then move to action to challenge the system that keeps them suffering?

The first mover in my proposed theory of change (at least as intimated by this quote) is one that maintains the fundamental power of the institution of higher ed. The institution of higher ed (and those with power in it) are fundamentally opposed to students. They can make change. Marginalized students cannot. The institution must make the change for the marginalized. It translates well to a bourgeois/proletariat model. Which got me thinking about ISA's - or Ideological State Apparatuses - hello 20th century marxist theory - which I haven't read enough of because it makes me really sad - if and only if because it's fight against misery is a pretty tragic and miserable tale. (I would like to note that don't think all of higher ed transcribes to a bourg/prol model - but it is a useful metaphor).

Louis Althusser talks about ISA's in ["Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm) as institutions that function primarily through ideology (pledging allegiance to flags, submitting to gpa hierachies, etc) and secondarily through repression (punishment, expulsion, selection, etc). Schools are such institutions. They're natural - and they make the reproduction of the current hierarchical system of production seem the "natural" thing. Here's an example of 20th century Marxist theory making me feel hopeless:

>I ask the pardon of those teachers who, in dreadful conditions, attempt to turn the few weapons they can find in the history and learning they ‘teach’ against the ideology, the system and the practices in which they are trapped. They are a kind of hero. But they are rare and how many (the majority) do not even begin to suspect the ‘work’ the system (which is bigger than they are and crushes them) forces them to do, or worse, put all their heart and ingenuity into performing it with the most advanced awareness (the famous new methods!). So little do they suspect it that their own devotion contributes to the maintenance and nourishment of this ideological representation of the School, which makes the School today as ‘natural’, indispensable-useful and even beneficial for our contemporaries as the Church was ‘natural’, indispensable and generous for our ancestors a few centuries ago.

And the fundamental role of a good ideological critic is to challenge the very things that seem natural - cause "natural" tends to be a guise for oppression, repression and the like.

And so schools, through ideology, fundamentally reproduce the relations of production - making it all seem natural. That's their role and responsibility as an ISA. And so when I talk about people "just needing work" I feed into this vision:

>For many, postsecondary education must be, very simply, about attainment that leads to work. An online course is not about becoming “democratically engaged” - it’s about obtaining a specific prerequ, certificate, or qualification. My liberal arts degree (English) will be successful because of the pre-existing social capital (and capital capital) I sit in.

"Naturally", some people just need work. And others get liberal arts degrees. I, bourgeois fellow that I am (note the irony of the "I am" here), then seem to be feeding into "natural" hierarchy - class division. I'm entrusting social change to those who currently have power and authority (conference organizers, English majors, and educators) rather than trusting marginalized students first and foremost. I'm begging for the gratitude of access rather than challenging the very strange hierarchy that gives conferences the strange role that they have. In fact, I'd say that my post - and this one as well - is really just a way to further entrench my own power - give me a seat at the table of the powerful - run away from empathy under the guise of pursuing empathy (meta-meta-meta).

My assumption in the last piece is that student voice is something that must be made space for by folks in power because only those in power have the power to make change. No one else can make change. In fact, "student voice" must beg for space and then inhabit it at the whims of the Ideological State Apparatus.

If the chief purpose of ideology is to reproduce the status quo, then is there any chance that my current vision of "Student Voice" as a movement is actually doing more to contribute to the status quo than to jam the wheel and flip the table? What is the role of Higher Ed as a subversive space - aware of its ironies - cognizant of its histories?

Could it be that true empowerment resists something else? What, then, is that else? What, then, is my role in that fight? What's the difference between leveraging power "for" someone - and leveraging it "with" someone.

And how does this translate to a series of panels at a Higher Ed conference? What's effective? What is my theory of social change?
