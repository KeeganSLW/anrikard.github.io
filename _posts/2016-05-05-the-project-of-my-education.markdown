_This will be a series of quotes and thoughts_

At the moment, I'm thinking about education in terms of small "projects" - not systemic change.

>One aspect of the reply is to be found in the distinction between systematic education, which can only be changed by political power, and educational projects, which should be carried out with the oppressed in the process of organizing them.

Freire, Paulo (2014-08-18). Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition (Kindle Locations 692-694). Bloomsbury Publishing. Kindle Edition.

Resolving the following contradiction - who in my life has resolved this contradiction?

>Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students.

Freire, Paulo (2014-08-18). Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition (Kindle Locations 1003-1005). Bloomsbury Publishing. Kindle Edition.

"Roaming Autodidacts" - through [Audrey Watters](http://hackeducation.com/2016/03/25/lifelong-learning-lol) to [Tressie McMillan Cottom](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/inequality-regimes-and-student-experience-in-online-learning-tressie-mcmillan-cottom). And the moment where roaming autodidact sounded like everything I wanted to be. Before realizing the broken alienation implicit in it. The disgusting assumptions inherent in it.

> The roaming autodidact is a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded in technocratic futures and disembedded from place, culture, history, and markets. - Cottom

Adaptive learning technology and Paulo:

>And since people “receive” the world as passive entities, education should make them more passive still, and adapt them to the world. The educated individual is the adapted person, because she or he is better “fit” for the world. Translated into practice, this concept is well suited to the purposes of the oppressors, whose tranquility rests on how well people fit the world the oppressors have created, and how little they question it.

Amidst other things - thinking about teaching with bell hooks.
