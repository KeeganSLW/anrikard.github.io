_tldr come hang with me tomorrow in the Plugin Lounge at OLCInnovate. Especially if you're a student. Here's the [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/a/edsurge.com/forms/d/1Ch2MDvCmFsCCeJVH-BhkwFEvGz5R9UEA_2qM4ALO23s/viewform?c=0&w=1)._

Conferences aren't made for students. At all. And it's structural, not an individual's fault, but everyone's problem. It's the collective result of a great slew of sloppy power structures.

I'm Andrew, a lucky student from a Liberal Arts College, privileged. I am not here because I'm qualified (or at least my few qualifications aren't due to other qualifications). Rather I got to know the right faculty at the right time - radical faculty - innovative folks.

After a couple of conferences, this is the first conference I feel like I understand. It's comfortable to me. I know what works - and what doesn't. I can use the hashtag like a pro. I can be perfectly snarky about things like Vendors and Moocs. I've gained access to some interesting communities. And people ask, "How the hell are you here?"

I'm unsure. The idea of a conference is to gather together a group of people who do the same thing in different places. In this case, the "group" does education - digital ed. So academics, technologists, and industry folks are here. And they have a language - a jargon - to exchange information. And that language - which is based around students and their lives - is totally inaccessible to students and their lives.

And somehow this inaccessibility - which has so much more to do with power than it does with intellect or capability or motivation - has us thinking it has everything to do with intellect or capability or motivation. In fact, students don't care. This would go over their heads. They don't care about pedagogy.

And over the course of the past two days I've heard the word "empathy" used endlessly. But there's no empathy if you don't feel like you have a say in the structures that dominate you. In fact, you're herded, alienated - both parties are debarred from empathy.

Instead of hearing folks who were students 20 years ago telling a crowd of not student that students like things like "likes" and "instagrams" and "frat parties" why don't we bring more of them here, providing tracks for their networking and participation, in order to create better tools, programs, and systems for them to live in. Having a say in your own governance is democracy. The uncomfortably fundamental assumption that students don't care about the structures, ideologies, and powers that dominate the first 16 (at least) years of their lives feeds that system.

And so, again, conferences aren't made for students. They're made for talking about students (oh and drinking - lol - lots of drinking - I'm drinking now). They're made to perpetuate a culture that doesn't believe students should have a representation in the structures that dominate them.

And so I think the first step we should take is to include more students - and tracks for students - in these professional gathering about students. It's the democratic thing. And it's the uncomfortable thing. But its the vital thing.

Examples could include:
- reaching out to cohorts from local institutions of higher ed. Don't fly students in. Bring in the ones right here.
- create legitimate tracks for students, providing student-led sessions introducing the language and style of conferences.
- market access to virtual participation. Encourage cohorts from institutions to watch, discuss, and participate in the cloud.

If you trust students, enlighten them on the codes and structures of ed, and then invite them to dinner, they'll surprise the hell out of you.

If you've made it this far, scroll back to the top and come to our session tomorrow.
