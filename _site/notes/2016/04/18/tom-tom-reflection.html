    <p>I came to Charlottesville to connect with folks doing powerful work in Education. I did. So here’s another reflection. I’m 30 minutes away from a presentation by Mary Jo Madda, Senior EdSurge Editor, and all-around bad*ss. And a need a moment to repaint the picture I started yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-community">Focus on Community</h3>

<p>What’s permeated every aspect of this trip is the community focus of this town - so many powerful intersections between students, community partners, local teachers/administrators. You hear a similar slew of names come up again and again, across borders.</p>

<p>When we’re looking to shake up education for good, it won’t happen with an eye glancing up towards the feds. It’ll come as a collaborative effort around a community. Now Charlottesville has the distinct privilege of surrounding a world-class university, flush with Virginia’s brilliance. And the community has leveraged these minds for change, partnering to create spaces where students can keep a foot in school and a foot in the world. These split students, living lives at the border of courses and community effectually pop bubbles where they find them. (But both privileged of course: the school and the community.)</p>

<h3 id="a-community-at-the-border-of-communities">A Community at the Border of Communities</h3>
<p>The best example of this idea is the organization, <strong>Hack CVille</strong>. When I first showed up in this town on Wednesday (jeez I’ve been here for a while), I worked late into the night inside their <em>clubhouse</em>, sponsored by UVA, but founded separate from it. It’s off-campus, community guided, and student run - they’ve got couches, coffee machines, and horde of stickers, post-its, and posters. They work to offer students a space to incubate ideas for community change. This isn’t technically for Entrepreneurship, but rather for entrepreneurial endeavors. They encourage a project-based approach to change, offering a place to rethink, redesign, or reimagine something or another. It’s opt-in, loosely scaffolded, and open deep into the night on a Wednesday. I can’t help but wonder what curriculum credit would do to their passion… Poison it? Perhaps?</p>

<h2 id="entrepreneurial-spirit">Entrepreneurial Spirit</h2>
<p>This <em>spirit</em> is different from the act of perpetual pitchmanship. Something about pitching always hits me wrong - it feels fake and a tid-bit nasty. I understand it’s purpose, but the nearly unmediated chase after capital makes me uncomfortable. Cash or credits tend to feel dirty. They’ve gotta sit secondary if we’re gonna honor true passion.</p>

<p>But the spirit of entrepreneurship, the ever-glorified “find a problem and solve it.” Well, I love it. And that’s the uncapturable essence we’ve got to capture and plug into EDU. Because that right there is what we <strong>need</strong> in education. First and foremost because education has a laundry list of fixable problems on it that doesn’t leverage the millions of minds who walk it’s long, flourescent corridors. If we’re looking for motivation, a group of students sitting at the border of school &amp; community, skeptical of both, and willing to challenge the “way of things” with new solutions would (could) do the trick.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest lesson I’ve learned this week is that liminal space (that space at the border) feels key to whole human-ship. Buying whole-heartedly into singular ideologies screws us over. Feels most relevant to create a life with different limbs in different arenas - forming community in the spaces between. Together, we identity ourselves as a group of conflicted identities.</p>

<p>And I realize how utterly basic this sounds.</p>

<p>BUT - this is interdisciplinarity, breaking down time blocks, credit structures, hyper-focused unapplied lectures. De-siloing. We must desilo.</p>
