    <p>So many thoughts.</p>

<p>After a week and a half on the road, I’m sitting in Davidson’s Visual Art’s Center lounge with a breath of quiet. I got home Saturday midday and slept for ~18 hours. I kid you not.</p>

<p>I’m attempting to sort through this whole slew of experiences - from Tom Tom Fest at UVA to OLC in NOLA, sifting through for themes. And the first, obvious one, is Student Voice. Where do students and their voices belong? Why do they belong there?</p>

<p>See, it’s easy for me to get vitriolic about this: students (literally average age of 28 in Higher Ed) don’t have much of a say in their higher ed experience. They’re treated like consumers, not collaborators. They shuffle in and out of rooms or software packages for credits, degrees, and (now recently) badges. But I want to say that a purpose of Higher Ed (amidst many) is to forge some critical, democratically engaged citizens. By this I mean folks who look at the systems and structures they’re a part of and ask difficult questions. Like, “Why am I sitting in this classroom? Is there a better way to do this?” I want to see students who believe fundamentally in challenging the status quo.</p>

<p>And the kickback I get most often comes in two flavors: one of which I’ll recount here. And they’re two arguments that matter deeply. I’m curious about them. I don’t know the answer. But I get told this:</p>

<h2 id="your-privilege-lets-you-challenge-the-status-quo---most-people-just-need-work">Your privilege lets you challenge the status quo - most people just need work.</h2>

<p>Which is true. I’ve been given, undeservingly, a vast array of privilege. For many, postsecondary education <em>must</em> be, very simply, about attainment that leads to work. An online course is not about becoming “democratically engaged” - it’s about obtaining a specific prerequ, certificate, or qualification. My liberal arts degree (English) will be successful because of the pre-existing social capital (and capital capital) I sit in. In fact, the ability for me to ask these questions without the appropriate empathy for the average student is fundamentally problematic.</p>

<p>This becomes the sort of back and forth that ends up in the Atlantic time and time again - where one side argues for better vocational training (get more people more quality jobs) and then another side that says whoa whoa whoa - what about the liberal arts? And then the one side says that the liberal arts are for elitists who have pre-existing capital and opportunity - and the other side says that art &amp; beauty &amp; philosophy are for everyone and to claim that the “average joe” doesn’t deserve them is racist, classist, and absurd.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to sort this out.</p>

<p>Because on the one hand, food without philosophy seems to be better than philosophy without food. But on the other hand, creating a populace critical of authoritarian impulses seems to be particularly relevant at this moment. We need more radicals, skeptics, and builders. We need a little more art and creativity and empathy. But at what cost?</p>

<p>I think the question that this “privilege” comment implies, is that most people don’t have the time or ability to question the status quo. They’re just trying to make it. But I think this is kind of screwey because the folks most suffering under the way things then have the least opportunity to voice their opinions to change it. They’re silenced.</p>

<p>And so perhaps the answer to this is to make spaces for challenging the “way things are” for people who don’t have the time and resources to challenge the way things are. And so <em>my</em> challenge to the way things are is: How might education create spaces for those most suffering in the status quo to express their suffering and then move to action to challenge the system that keeps them suffering?</p>

<p>That, for me, means encouraging student voice at conferences. Paying for marginalized students to speak on panels. Encouraging empathy between those who are making the system and those who are submitting to it. Getting student voices on paper and in podcasts and in the news. Because as long as privilege is a prerequisite to challenging the status quo, we’re not operating in a democracy. As long as you need money and access before you can be heard, well - you’re f-ed.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know if this is the answer. Or even how to pitch an answer. Because I really don’t have the greatest degree of empathy. But I’m working on it. And I’d love for you - if you read this - to respond to me in a Twitter DM or an email (in the footer). Lots to know.</p>
