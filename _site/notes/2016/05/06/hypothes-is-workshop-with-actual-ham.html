    <p><em>Questions by workshop participants will occur in italics</em></p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I drove to the CLT airport to pick up the ever wondrous and esteemed <a href="https://twitter.com/actualham?lang=en">Robin DeRosa</a>, who will be talking and workshopping at Davidson for the next few days.</p>

<p>And the talk we had through the I-77 traffic confirmed all the good vibes: Foucault, Open, Access, Problematic, Deconstructed, Badges, Early American Lit, Modernism, Perspective, Empathy. More to come in a recounting of the weekend and my perpetually developing perspective.</p>

<p>And I’m sitting in an annotation workshop at this very moment, walking through <a href="hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a> with a crowd of fac/staff/and…am I the only student? Probs.</p>

<p>We’re beginning with this tweet and its doc:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the outline for my <a href="https://twitter.com/hypothes_is">@hypothes_is</a> workshop starting now at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPENunbound?src=hash">#OPENunbound</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidsonCollege">@DavidsonCollege</a>. <a href="https://t.co/Ansmz2P8e7">https://t.co/Ansmz2P8e7</a></p>&mdash; Robin DeRosa (@actualham) <a href="https://twitter.com/actualham/status/728569273883365381">May 6, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And now we’re off.</p>

<p>This talk shifts between “how to use hypothesis” and “the ideological implications of the open web.” Both are awesome threads. Read on.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-hypothesis">Introducing Hypothes.is</h2>

<p>Since I’m familiar with Hypothes.is and the concept of OPEN - I’m going to spend some of this recounting the process by which Robin introduces these concepts. Lol - actually - considering this is live notetaking, it’ll just recount her presentation with comments embedded of my own.</p>

<h4 id="super-public">Super public.</h4>

<p>She encourages her courses to write entirely in public - courses using twitter - etc.</p>

<p><em>Q- When are staff responsible for what their students put online?</em>
Introducing the continuum of open: Robin talks about being on the extreme edge of open - what does it mean to encourage students to annotate Freud’s Anal Eroticism in the open. And… if you have access - <a href="http://www.ricorso.net/rx/library/criticism/guest/Freud_S/Freud_S4.htm">check it out</a>. Or you could use… groups.</p>

<h4 id="groups-or-entirely-private">Groups or… Entirely private.</h4>

<p>Private. So if you don’t want your students commenting in public, well, put folks in a group. Helps with FAFSA etc. You can also use Hypothes.is entirely in private.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-students-say-about-hypothesis">What do students say about Hypothes.is?</h2>

<p>Robin presented a <a href="https://hypothes.is/blog/undergrad-shannon-griffiths-on-using-hypothesis-in-the-classroom/">student piece</a>, recounting the experience of using hypothesis.</p>

<p>She introduces “factual recall.” And the way to react to folks with articles like “10000 reasons why laptops in the classroom are the devil.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/teaching-with-the-internet-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-google-in-my-classroom/">Interesting piece on google in the classroom by Adeline Koh.</a></p>

<p>Robin’s interested in the way that community arises out of the casual nature of the web. There’s a massive return in a joke in the margins of a web page. This is an affordance.</p>

<p>She opens her courses with “What is the problem with using screens in class?” Asking students how to best learn… A crowdsourced policy creation by students for students at the beginning of a course. “How might we <em>best</em> use technology in the classroom, for learning?”</p>

<h2 id="a-splendid-piece-on-online-readinghttpsviahypothesishttpwwwnewyorkercomsciencemaria-konnikovabeing-a-better-online-reader"><a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/being-a-better-online-reader">A splendid piece on online reading</a></h2>

<h2 id="reading-and-thinking-online-as-a-political-act">Reading and thinking online as a political act.</h2>
<p><em>from hypothesis kickstarter campaign - thinking about what has been done, what is no longer being done, and what has become problematic</em></p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/29633009">Hypothes.is Intro</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user7906166">Hypothes.is</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Hypothesis as a tool for the dissemination of knowledge, to open up the locked-down nature of individual web sites. How do we communicate where we are not supposed to communicate? How do we examine, explore, and challenge knowledge as it exists?</p>

<h4 id="comments-and-questions-on-the-video">Comments and questions on the video</h4>
<p><em>Q - What about scholarly peer review? How do we balance expert peer review with democratic peer review?</em>
A - Not currently a way to annotate in public such that others cannot… Or ways to see that certain individuals are experts on the pages. Mentions hypothesis flash mobs - where on say, 8pm on a Thursday you could bring together a group of Climate experts to annotate an article on climate change deniers.</p>

<p><em>Q - What about hypothesis as a space for harrassment?</em>
More thoughts on ownership of webspace. If hypothesis is a layer on your site, is that a challenge to your webspace? Who is responsible for abuse?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does it means to annotate someone&#39;s blog? <a href="https://t.co/x7imCkRgG6">https://t.co/x7imCkRgG6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GardnerCampbell">@GardnerCampbell</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/anrikard">@anrikard</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hypothes_is">@hypothes_is</a>  <a href="https://t.co/epPeWLGyrt">https://t.co/epPeWLGyrt</a></p>&mdash; Robin DeRosa (@actualham) <a href="https://twitter.com/actualham/status/714503528526516225">March 28, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Follow this tweet chain if you’re interested. I see it in two ways. You could envision open annotation as a way to give voice to those who cannot speak: annotations on locked-down sites - spaces without comments. OR - you could envision open annotation as a new way to abuse folks.</p>

<p><em>Q - What about the author being annotated unknowingly?</em>
Even happened to Robin. What is the infrastructure to get the annotations to the author?</p>

<p>How do you make the web eternally dialogic? How do you make everything conversational? How do you encourage conversation, network, and equity on the web?</p>

<p>And… how do you introduce these troubles with OPEN to students? She believes you have to introduce the pedagogical implications of this work. Teaching OPEN as PROCESS is vital.</p>

<p>And then - what is your opt-out policy? For privacy, safety, etc.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion.</h2>

<p>Awesome session. Interesting tool to “oo -oo - make notes online” but also to reconsider, challenge, and reflect on the political, ideological, communal implications of OPEN. Tools have ideologies. Not neutral. The algorithm carries assumptions within its affordances.</p>
