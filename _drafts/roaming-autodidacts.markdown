- Hack CVille
- Davidson IE

### Apprenticeship models

Nikhil Goyal - mentorship - community - empathy - as occurs in communion with the work. Learn from those you find fascinating - follow them and imitate.

### Portfolio based assessment

How do you assess these models? Where success isn't an abstract metric. Where the final purpose is not the assessment itself, but the continuity of the project at hand.

"The roaming autodidact is a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded in technocratic futures and disembedded from place, culture, history, and markets." - [Tressie McMillan Cottom](https://tressiemc.com/2014/07/28/democratizing-ideologies-and-inequality-regimes-berkman-center-primer/).
