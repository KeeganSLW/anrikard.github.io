I wrote a post on Monday that moved through some educator circles. And I've got this gut feeling that the act of writing in public was a lil more interesting than some of the assumptions/presumptions buried in the post. Considering those that read my writing are more likely than not educators - and more likely than not interested in the systems/structures/powers/ideologies present in text/culture/education - well, could I be your student?

Could you see these posts as experimental? Exploratory? Process-oriented?

Because I'd rather this blog be about listening than 'splaining - especially in a world of such brilliant thinkers. And I'd rather start conversations than see retweets - cause "cool post mr. undergrad" doesn't help much with growth. And to make my own writings revolve around listening demands an community that speaks back.

Of course this is already being done, but it never hurt to make it official. Please send questions and challenges. I'm a student in this space - and a writer too. So down to collaborate in public.
