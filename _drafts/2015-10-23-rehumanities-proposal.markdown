Scraping Mold Off Immortality - Mina Loy in the Digital Age  
===========================================================

"CONSCIOUSNESS cannot spontaneously accept or reject new forms, as offered by creative genius; it is the new form, for however great a period of time it may remain a mere irritant --- that moulds consciousness to the necessary amplitude for holding it." -Mina Loy, Aphorisms on Futurism

I.  HER

Mina Loy (born 1882) - Poet, Artist, Actress, Entrepreneur - is the sensual, obscene, transatlantic voice of the then "Modern Woman". Over her extensive career, she would be labelled Futurist, Dadaist, Surrealist, Feminist, and bitch. Pound loved her. Lowell hated her. She was loud, flamboyant, and boldly flouted any overarching categorization. She talked sex like Foucault, gender like Butler, textuality like Derrida. She was ahead of her time - and then for 90 years she was lost, forgotten - until Dr. Carolyn Burke brought her back to life with a stunning biography.

II. OUR LOOSE CANON

In effect, Burke took part in the re-canonization of this period, opening the door for years of critical work by a wide array of scholars. She broke the traditional, formalist lens. But what could the Digital Humanities possibly have to do with this?

If we define the modern canon not in the Bloomian sense of the word - the great formative works of Western Culture - but rather as those highly integrated in our pedagogy, I believe that the Digital Humanities has a vital place in the act of canonization. As Universities move towards the digital, those works digitized, archived, linked, open-access, mapped, mined, and analyzed will rise rapidly within the 'modern canon' - within the modern pedagogy. I thus believe it is the role of the Digital Humanist to fight for the integration, digitization, and analysis of a-typical works - to  push on the leading paradigms of canonization. Shakespeare, Milton, Whitman, Pound, Faulkner, and Joyce have their digital archives and analysis. I'm researching as an active proponent of the 'who' - who do we focus our work on as Digital Humanists? Furthermore, how can data-mining large swaths of historic texts redefine our idea of what should be a member of our pedagogy - though brushed aside by the gate-keepers of literary immortality (those bourgeoise editors of old). Though the primary sources may not be nearly as extensive, though the difficulty of the work may rapidly escalate, those wildly brilliant representatives of the minority (like Loy) must be recognized and understood in the same way as their longer lasting counterparts, lest for ease of access and the proud judges of history we (those digital archivists) leave behind the progress of the last 40 years.

III. FINALLY - BREAK IT NEW

As the modern form and method shifts, the theory and intentionality of WHO we focus that analysis on must shift. With the capacities of instant digital access and e-publishing, no longer does the canon based on power and publishing rest in the hands of the few, but is now a democracy of focus. I hope, in this critical paper, to both question this structure as a canon with works - choices - to focus on, and then take a swing at the heart of the whole structure. Can the digital world support classics, or will the Loy's gain a scattered hold?
