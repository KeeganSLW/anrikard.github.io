### about

I'm at Davidson College. My friends don't know I care about words like "pedagogy" or "EdTech".

Tweet at me – @anrikard.

But yeah, I think about education quite a bit.

Academically, I’m interested in digital worlds, education, early 20th Century Literary Modernism, Feminist theory and criticism, network analysis, close readings and distant ones too.

I’ve written a couple of things for Edsurge. I actually work for them now. I'm an intern.

I’m on Linked-in – though its probably not updated. Cheers.
