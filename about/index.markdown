The name’s Andrew. Tweet at me – @anrikard.

I think about education quite a bit.

Academically, I’m interested in digital worlds, education, early 20th Century Literary Modernism, Feminist theory and criticism, network analysis, close readings and distant ones too.

I’ve written a couple of things for Edsurge.

I’m on Linked-in – though its probably not updated. Cheers.
